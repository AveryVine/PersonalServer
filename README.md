# Personal Server

This is my personal server. It might have some neat stuff that you want to try (like my awesome, mostly LoL-related Discord bot), so feel free to clone it and try stuff out.

## Setting Up

1. Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/AveryVine/PersonalServer.git`)
2. Navigate to the project directory in command line or terminal
3. Run `npm install`

## Running The Server

The server is built using TypeScript, so you will need to build the project before each run. From the directory in command line / terminal...

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Run `npm start`
